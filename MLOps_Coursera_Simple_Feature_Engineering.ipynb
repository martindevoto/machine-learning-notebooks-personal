        "In this lab, you will get some hands-on practice with the [Tensorflow Transform](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started) library (or `tf.Transform`). This serves to show what is going on under the hood when you get to use the [TFX Transform](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/transform) component within a TFX pipeline in the next labs. The code snippets and main discussions are taken from this [TensorFlow official notebook](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/transform/simple) but we have expounded on a few key points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preprocessing is often required in ML projects because the raw data is not yet in a suitable format for training a model. Not doing so usually results in the model not converging or having poor performance. Some standard transformations include normalizing pixel values, bucketizing, one-hot encoding, and the like. Consequently, these same transformations should also be done during inference to ensure that the model is computing the correct predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "With Tensorflow Transform, you can preprocess data using the same code for both training a model and serving inferences in production. It provides several utility functions for common preprocessing tasks including creating features that require a full pass over the training dataset. The outputs are the transformed features and a TensorFlow graph which you can use for both training and serving. Using the same graph for both training and serving can prevent feature skew, since the same transformations are applied in both stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this introductory exercise, you will walk through the \"Hello World\" of using TensorFlow Transform to preprocess input data. As you've seen in class, the main steps are to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Collect raw data\n",
        "2. Define metadata\n",
        "3. Create a preprocessing function\n",
        "4. Generate a constant graph with the required transformations\n",

        "In this lab, you went through the fundamentals of using Tensorflow Transform to turn raw data into features. This code can be used to transform both the training and serving data. However, the code can be quite complex if you'll be using this as a standalone library to build a pipeline (see this [notebook](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/transform/census) for reference). Now that you know what is going on under the hood, you can use a higher-level set of tools like [Tensorflow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) to simplify the process. This will abstract some of the steps you did here like manually defining schemas and using `tft_beam` functions. It will also leverage other libraries, such as TFDV, to perform other processes in the usual machine learning pipeline like detecting anomalies. You will get to see these in the next lab."
